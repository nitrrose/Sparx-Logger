A simple TKinter project I use to log my answers on Sparx Maths.

You can give the program a question number and answer, and it will save it to a .txt file.
Then, you can search based on question number within the program and it will display the answer.

Use:
Place the .py file in a folder along with a .txt file called `next_number` containing the number '1'.
Then, you can right click on the .py file to create a shortcut, which you can double click on to run the program.

If it doesn't run, download Python onto your computer (https://www.python.org/downloads/ <- download the latest version) and go to the command prompt (it will look like a black box).
Then, type `pip install tkinter` to download the TKinter library. The program should now run.

Getting a grip on the basics of TKinter, so the GUI is rather basic.

Thanks!
