A simple TKinter project I use to log my answers on Sparx Maths.

You can give the program a question number and answer, and it will save it to a .txt file.
Then, you can search based on question number within the program and it will display the answer.

Getting a grip on the basics of TKinter, so the GUI is rather basic.

Thanks!
